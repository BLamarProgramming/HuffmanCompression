Huffman Compressor and Decompressor in Python

The main.py file is setup to compress and decompress a .txt file. 
The only inputs required are three paths: one for the file you want compressed, a second for the compressed version, and a third for the decompressed version.
You can then measure the effectiveness of the compression by comparing the compressed filesize vs the original file or the decompressed file.
